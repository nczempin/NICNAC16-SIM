# NICNAC16 Instruction Set Specification

This directory acts as a stand in for a dedicated repository named
`NICNAC16-ISA`.  It contains a machine readable description of the
instruction set that can be shared between all tooling (simulator,
assembler, disassembler, compiler, ...).

The actual project should live in its own repository and be consumed as a
submodule by the individual tools.
